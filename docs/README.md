# WhatsApp To Discord

WhatsAppToDiscord is a Discord bot that uses WhatsApp Web as a bridge between Discord and WhatsApp. It is built on top of [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) and [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) libraries.

Originally created by [Fatih Kilic](https://github.com/FKLC), now maintained by [arespawn](https://github.com/arespawn).

> ✅ **Release channels:** Stable builds use tags like `v2.x.y`. Prereleases use tags like `v2.x.y-beta.N` and are published to the `unstable` update channel.

## Requirements

- Node.js 25 or higher

## Features

- Supports media (Image, Video, Audio, Document, Stickers) and reactions!
- Allows whitelisting, so you can choose what to see on Discord
- Translates mentions between WhatsApp and Discord
- Allows usage of WhatsApp through the Discord overlay
- Syncs message edits between WhatsApp and Discord
- Bridges WhatsApp polls into Discord (creation and live updates; voting stays in WhatsApp due to API limits)
- Uses minimal resources because it doesn't simulate a browser
- Open Source, you can see, modify and run your own version of the bot!
- Self Hosted, so your data never leaves your computer
- Automatically restarts itself if it crashes
- Checks for updates every couple of days and can apply signed updates on command (packaged builds only)

**Note:** Due to limitations of the WhatsApp Web protocol, the bot can only notify you of incoming or missed calls. It cannot forward the audio or video streams of a WhatsApp call to Discord.

## Security notes

- WA2DC intentionally does **not** implement per-user/role authorization for commands. Use Discord channel/role permissions (and Discord's command permissions UI) to control who can use the bot.
- Keep `#control-room` private. It contains WhatsApp QR codes and is where you manage links/updates/settings.
- Link previews are fetched by the bot host to generate WhatsApp previews. For safety, WA2DC blocks link-preview fetches to loopback/private/link-local addresses and enforces tight size/timeouts; internal URLs may not show a preview.
- Self-update is only supported when signed release artifacts are available (packaged builds that ship a matching `.sig` file). This signature is separate from Apple notarization/codesigning.

## Baileys 7 migration

This repository tracks Baileys `7.0.0-rc.9`. Upstream outlines every breaking change in their migration article: [https://whiskey.so/migrate-latest](https://whiskey.so/migrate-latest). Notes and common workarounds:

**Notes**

- Local Identifiers (LIDs) are now preferred over PN-based JIDs. The bot listens for `lid-mapping.update` events, migrates stored chats/whitelists as WhatsApp reveals PN↔LID pairs, and always talks to the chat using the identifier WhatsApp considers canonical.
- The Signal auth store seeds the newly required `lid-mapping`, `tctoken`, `device-list`, and `device-index` namespaces so rc.9 can write those blobs without crashing.

**Common issues & workarounds**

- **Duplicate Discord channels after the LID migration** – If a conversation suddenly starts flowing into a brand-new Discord channel, re-link it back to the original room via the control channel (`link --force <contact> #old-channel`) rather than editing files on disk. The bot will create a webhook inside the existing channel, clean up the stray webhook, and update its saved metadata. If you prefer to move the webhook that already exists in the duplicate channel, run `move #duplicate-channel #old-channel --force` so the bot reuses that webhook and deletes the redundant channel mapping for you.
- **Repeated "Connection was lost" logs** – WhatsApp occasionally drops the socket with timeout errors. The bot now keeps retrying with exponential backoff instead of deleting the session, so expect control-channel status messages while it reconnects. If the retries never succeed, rescan the QR code to refresh the session.

## Running

Start the bot with `npm start` or run the executable from the releases page. The start script watches the process and brings it back up if it crashes. Running `node src/index.js` directly skips this behaviour, so crashes will stop the bot.

Runtime logs are written to `logs.txt`. Everything printed to the terminal is also saved to `terminal.log`, which can help diagnose issues when running on a headless server.

Alternatively, you can run the bot using Docker. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, put your Discord bot token in it and execute:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The compose file mounts the `storage` directory so data is kept between container restarts. It uses the `latest` tag (stable channel) by default; switch to `unstable` if you explicitly want prerelease builds.

To update a running container, pull the new image and recreate the service:

```bash
docker compose pull wa2dc && docker compose up -d wa2dc
```

This keeps you in control of when updates are applied instead of auto-updating.

## Updates and release channels

- Images are pushed to the GitHub Container Registry on every release with immutable version tags plus moving `latest` (stable) and `unstable` channels.
- The bot checks for new releases every couple of days. Set `WA2DC_UPDATE_CHANNEL=unstable` to be notified about prereleases; otherwise it follows the stable channel.
- Packaged binaries can apply updates after you confirm with the `update` command. Set `WA2DC_KEEP_OLD_BINARY=1` to keep the previous executable as a rollback.
- Switch channels from the control channel with `updateChannel stable|unstable`.
- Packaged installs keep the previous binary so you can run `rollback` from the control channel if a release breaks.
- Docker and source installs only notify you. Review the changelog and pull a new image when you are ready.
- Pinning a specific version tag makes rollbacks easier on Docker.
