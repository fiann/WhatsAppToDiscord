# Commands

All bot controls now run exclusively through Discord slash commands. Type `/` in any channel to see the available commands (the bot must share the server) or narrow the list by typing `/wa` and selecting the desired action. Commands can be invoked anywhere, but responses are ephemeral outside the control channel. The legacy `#control-room` text commands have been removed—use slash commands or the persistent buttons in the control channel.

## Conversation Management

### `/pairwithcode`
Request a pairing code for a specific phone number.  
Usage: `/pairwithcode number:<E.164 phone number>`

### `/start`
Create a brand-new WhatsApp conversation and channel link.  
Usage: `/start contact:<phone number or saved contact name>`

### `/link`
Link an existing Discord text/news channel to an existing WhatsApp chat without creating anything new.  
Usage: `/link contact:<name or number> channel:<#channel> force:<true|false>`  
Enable `force` to override a channel that is already linked to another chat.

### `/move`
Move an existing WhatsApp link (and webhook) from one channel to another.  
Usage: `/move from:<#current-channel> to:<#new-channel> force:<true|false>`

### `/list`
List all known contacts and groups, optionally filtered.  
Usage: `/list query:<optional text>`

### `/poll`
Create a WhatsApp poll from Discord.  
Usage: `/poll question:"text" options:"opt1,opt2,..." select:<count> announcement:<true|false>`  
Notes: Poll messages and live vote updates are mirrored to Discord, voting can only be done directly in WhatsApp.

### `/setpinduration`
Set the default expiration time (24h, 7d, or 30d) for WhatsApp pins created from Discord.  
Usage: `/setpinduration duration:<24h|7d|30d>`

---

## Whitelist Controls

### `/listwhitelist`
Show the conversations currently allowed to bridge when the whitelist is enabled.

### `/addtowhitelist`
Add a linked channel to the whitelist.  
Usage: `/addtowhitelist channel:<#channel>`

### `/removefromwhitelist`
Remove a linked channel from the whitelist.  
Usage: `/removefromwhitelist channel:<#channel>`

---

## Formatting & Prefixes

### `/setdcprefix`
Override the prefix prepended to Discord → WhatsApp messages.  
Usage: `/setdcprefix prefix:<optional text>` (omit to reset to usernames)

### `/dcprefix`
Toggle whether the configured prefix is used.  
Usage: `/dcprefix enabled:<true|false>`

### `/waprefix`
Toggle whether WhatsApp sender names are prepended inside Discord messages.  
Usage: `/waprefix enabled:<true|false>`

### `/waplatformsuffix`
Toggle whether WhatsApp messages mirrored to Discord include a suffix showing the sender platform (Android/iOS/Desktop/Web).  
Usage: `/waplatformsuffix enabled:<true|false>`

---

## Privacy

### `/hidephonenumbers`
Hide WhatsApp phone numbers on Discord (use pseudonyms when a real contact name isn’t available).  
Usage: `/hidephonenumbers enabled:<true|false>`

---

## Mentions

WA2DC can optionally translate WhatsApp @mentions into Discord user mentions, if you link a WhatsApp contact to a Discord user.
This only works for **real WhatsApp mentions** (select the person from WhatsApp’s mention picker); manually typing `@name` without selecting won’t include mention metadata and can’t be translated reliably.
If a WhatsApp contact is linked, WA2DC will also translate **Discord user @mentions** into **WhatsApp mentions** when forwarding messages from Discord to WhatsApp (you must use a real Discord mention — select the user from autocomplete so Discord inserts a `<@...>` mention).

### `/linkmention`
Link a WhatsApp contact to a Discord user so future WhatsApp @mentions ping them in Discord.  
Usage: `/linkmention contact:<phone number or saved contact name> user:<@user>`
Note: phone numbers can include `+`, spaces, or dashes; WA2DC normalizes them automatically.
Note: WhatsApp can represent the same person as a phone JID (`...@s.whatsapp.net`, “PN”) and/or a Linked-Device ID (`...@lid`, “LID”). If mentions don’t ping even though the link exists, you may be receiving **LID mentions**. You can link the LID directly by passing it as the contact value, e.g. `/linkmention contact:<someid@lid> user:<@user>`. On older versions, you may need to link **both** the PN and LID for the same contact.

### `/unlinkmention`
Remove a WhatsApp→Discord mention link for a contact.  
Usage: `/unlinkmention contact:<phone number or saved contact name>`

### `/mentionlinks`
List all configured WhatsApp→Discord mention links.

### `/jidinfo`
Show the known WhatsApp IDs (PN `@s.whatsapp.net` and/or LID `@lid`) for a contact, and whether those IDs are linked for mention pings.  
Usage: `/jidinfo contact:<phone number or saved contact name>`
How to find PN/LID:
- Easiest: run `/jidinfo contact:<name or number>` and look for lines marked `(PN)` and `(LID)`.
- Advanced: open `storage/contacts` and search for the contact name; keys ending in `@s.whatsapp.net` are PN, keys ending in `@lid` are LID.

## Attachments & Downloads

Defaults (out of the box):

- Local downloads are disabled (`/localdownloads enabled:true` to turn on).
- Download directory is `./downloads` and pruning is disabled (`/setdownloadlimit`, `/setdownloadmaxage`, `/setdownloadminfree` all default to `0` = off).
- Local download server is disabled; when enabled it defaults to local-only (`127.0.0.1` bind, `localhost` URLs, port `8080`).
- Download links are signed (survive restarts) and never expire by default (`/setdownloadlinkttl seconds:0`).

To make download links reachable from other devices (phone/PC), you usually want:

- `/setlocaldownloadserverbindhost host:0.0.0.0` (listen on all interfaces)
- `/setlocaldownloadserverhost host:<LAN IP or domain>` (generate URLs recipients can reach)
- Ensure firewall/port forwarding allows the configured port (default `8080`)

### `/waupload`
Toggle whether Discord attachments are uploaded to WhatsApp (vs sending as links).  
Usage: `/waupload enabled:<true|false>`

### `/localdownloads`
Control whether large WhatsApp attachments are downloaded locally when they exceed Discord’s upload limit.  
Usage: `/localdownloads enabled:<true|false>`

### `/getdownloadmessage`

Usage: `/setdownloadminfree gb:<number>` (0 disables free-space pruning)

### `/setfilesizelimit`
Override the Discord upload size limit used to decide when to download instead of re-uploading.  
Usage: `/setfilesizelimit bytes:<integer>`

### `/setdownloadlinkttl`
Set local download link expiry in seconds.  
Usage: `/setdownloadlinkttl seconds:<integer>` (0 = never expire)

### `/localdownloadserver`

Turn read receipts on or off entirely.  
Usage: `/readreceipts enabled:<true|false>`

Usage: `/changenotifications enabled:<true|false>`

### `/oneway`

## Update Management

The control channel now shows a persistent update card with “Update”, “Skip update”, and “Roll back” buttons that survive restarts. These buttons trigger the same slash commands listed below.

### `/checkupdate`
Manually check for updates on the active channel.

### `/skipupdate`
Dismiss the current update notification without installing.

### `/update`
Download and install the available release (packaged installs only). Docker/source deployments will be reminded to pull and restart manually.

### `/rollback`
Restore the previous packaged binary when one is available. The dedicated “Roll back” button only appears if a backup exists.

Need help remembering the command names? Type `/wa` inside Discord and let the client autocomplete each slash command along with its required options. All commands are self-documented via Discord’s UI, so you no longer have to memorize legacy text formats.
