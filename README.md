WhatsAppToDiscord (WA2DC) is a self-hosted bridge that mirrors WhatsApp chats into Discord using WhatsApp Web (via [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys)) and a Discord bot (via [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)).

Originally created by [Fatih Kilic](https://github.com/FKLC), the project is now maintained by [arespawn](https://github.com/arespawn) with the blessing of the previous author.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 or higher (or Docker)

## Highlights

- Mirrors messages, media, reactions, and edits between WhatsApp and Discord
- Lets you whitelist which chats appear in Discord
- Bridges WhatsApp polls into Discord (creation and live updates; voting stays in WhatsApp due to API limits)
- Self-hosted: runs on your own machine/server

## Security notes

- WA2DC intentionally relies on Discord permissions for access control. Keep the control channel private and restrict who can use bot commands using Discord role/channel permissions.
